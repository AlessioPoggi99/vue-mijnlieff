            The game is played on a 4 x 4 square grid. Each Player has eight pieces with two of four different symbols. 
            Each piece when played determines where your opponent can play their next piece. 
            For example you can force your opponent to play in a straight line (either othogonally or diagonally) from the piece just played, 
            or to play next to or away from the piece just played. 
            The aim is to form lines of 3 pieces of your color to get a point or lines of 4 that worth you two points. 
            When game ends the player with highest score wins.

            N.B. In every game first blue piece must be placed in one of the edge board tiles.

            As soon as one player places their last piece their opponent gets ONE last chance to play, which they forsake if they have to PASS, and the game ends. The player with most points wins.
